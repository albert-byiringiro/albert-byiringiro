# 👋 Hi, I'm Albert Byiringiro!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a junior developer who loves learning new things and building cool stuff. I enjoy making websites and apps that are simple, useful, and fun to use. Whether it's designing how things look or figuring out how they work behind the scenes, I’m always excited to take on new challenges and improve my skills.

I’m also curious about new technologies, and one day, I want to learn about machine learning to create even smarter apps.

When I'm not coding, I focus on staying healthy. I like reading books, especially about real-life stories, and listening to interesting podcasts like Diary of a CEO, Ask Pastor John and the ones from FreeCodeCamp. I enjoy swimming, listening to classical music (Mozart is really cool!), and I believe singing is a must in life. I also find peace in praying, taking walks, and spending time with my nieces—they always make me smile.
